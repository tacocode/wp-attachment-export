## Description ##

### Note: Obsolete since WordPress 4.4 ###

[This feature has been added into the core of WordPress 4.4](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32230). You can now export your attachments by going to Tools->Export and select 'Media' as the export type.

#### Original Description ####

WP Attachment Export allows you to export your media library into a WordPress eXtended RSS or WXR file. You can then use the Tools->Import function in another WordPress installation to import the media library.
